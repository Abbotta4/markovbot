[14:12:00] <Rifterabjd> now i remember
[14:12:21] <Rifterabjd> i think i heard your voice where you cited the interjection
[14:12:43] <Sinc> I did the interjection, yes
[14:14:43] <Turbo> What's with that clicking sound
[14:15:08] <Sinc> the one that happens twice in that clip?
[14:15:13] <Turbo> Yes
[14:15:32] <Sinc> That's called a glottal stop, as heard through a studio mic without a pop filter
[14:15:52] <Turbo> So... How to get rid of it?
[14:16:00] <Sinc> Well, I could use a pop filter
[14:16:02] <plebeian> remove your epiglottis

[14:16:41] <plebeian> no
[14:16:43] <Sinc> I could also just move a bit away from mic
[14:16:49] <sneak> or
[14:16:50] <Sinc> But nah, removing my epiglottis is simpler
[14:16:50] <plebeian> you will choke every time you eat or drink something though
[14:16:53] <sneak> get a pop filter
[14:16:56] <sneak> dur
[14:16:58] <Sinc> I have one
[14:17:06] <Sinc> I'm just not using it
[14:17:22] <sneak> is it a wire coat hanger with some old tights stretched over it
[14:17:30] <Sinc> That's my old one
[14:17:32] <Sinc> but I have a new one now

[14:19:41] <sneak> blue yeti a best consumer mic!!!1
[14:19:50] <sneak> totally not a shillfest!
[14:19:50] <Turbo> Sinc: What's the advantage of getting an expensive mic compared to putting together a cheapo electret mic, a low noise op amp, a nice 24bit DAC and serial to usb chip?
[14:19:53] <Sinc> zoom h2n or h4n is best consumer mic
[14:19:56] <Sinc> But blue is pretty decent
[14:20:11] <sneak> blue have way better shilling than zoom
[14:20:20] <Sinc> Turbo, the first advantage is only needing to carry one thing with you ;)
[14:20:36] <Sinc> zoom have no advertising at all
[14:20:38] <Sinc> gg
[14:20:55] <Sinc> They only even make sales because they market their products to photography stores and people buy them for shitty home movies
[14:21:02] <sneak> wot
[14:21:39] <plebeian> there's also an audio industry that use zoom mics for a bunch of things
[14:21:44] <plebeian> good job on ignoring that
[14:21:51] <Sinc> Sure, but aren't we talking about consumer mics?

[14:22:44] <sneak> yes
[14:23:53] <sneak> dont people make shitty home movies with shitty equipment 
[14:23:56] <Sinc> I liked the H2n way more than Yeti, for same price, definitely
[14:24:16] <Sinc> Yeti looks nicer, though; maybe that's part of it, too

[17:26:56] <S3tanta> isn't preventing communism the only thing that matters?

[17:28:09] <Baconaetor> and besides almost all the times we "supported" a group it's been incidental
[17:28:11] <Sinc> Kneecap some brits for me
[17:28:12] <ganye> > I don't think we really supported ISIL ever
[17:28:15] <ganye> ... are you serious?

[17:28:21] <ganye> ISIS is a direct result of our government
[17:28:22] <S3tanta> literally sheep tier
[17:28:27] <ganye> like, this isn't even a tenuous link
[17:28:28] <Baconaetor> we did arm Syrian rebels, that's true
[17:28:32] <ganye> we are *directly* responsible
[17:28:39] <Baconaetor> but Syrian rebels != ISIL
[17:28:39] <ganye> the Bush administration *directly* funded them
[17:28:51] <S3tanta> Sinc: tfw Sinn Fein gonna take power soon
[17:28:53] <Baconaetor> I'm sure there is overlap there though
[17:28:54] <TP> ISIS is still getting regular weapons deliveries from turgs and the US
[17:28:56] <ganye> we directly helped terrorist organizations form by shoving them all in Gitmo
[17:28:56] <Baconaetor> which is unfortunate
[17:29:09] <S3tanta> But ISIS are Syrian rebels
[17:29:21] <S3tanta> they fight against Assad and fought alongside the FSA for a time
[17:29:24] <Baconaetor> lol, how you gonna form a cell from GTMO?

[17:29:43] <ganye> are you an idiot?
[17:29:49] <Baconaetor> yeah, but ISIL also fought the syrian rebels we were supporting
[17:29:58] <ganye> you realize that the majority of gangs are controlled by people in prisons, correct?
[17:30:02] <Baconaetor> GTMO != prison
[17:30:04] <S3tanta> Baconaetor: shit changes
[17:30:07] <ganye> yes it is
[17:30:11] <ganye> it's a military prison
[17:30:11] <Baconaetor> otherwise the ACLU wouldn't be all over it
[17:30:13] <S3tanta> GTMO is literally a prison
[17:30:13] <ganye> lmao
[17:30:17] <ganye> what?
[17:30:20] <ganye> how do you figure?
[17:30:24] <ganye> the ACLU doesn't care about prisons?
[17:30:25] <ganye> lmao
[17:30:25] <S3tanta> just because it is an unlawful prison, doesn't change the fact that is a prison
[17:30:29] <Baconaetor> yes, but it's not like civilan prison 
[17:30:38] <Baconaetor> you don't get your daily phone call at GTMO
[17:30:41] <S3tanta> ACLU only cares about gaining political power
[17:30:42] <ganye> what the fuck do you expect happens when you shove a bunch of angry terrorists in a small facility together?
[17:30:44] <ganye> you don't need it
[17:30:51] <ganye> you form connections, people get let out, and then they act
[17:31:02] <Baconaetor> lol not if you're in solitary
[17:31:03] <ganye> holy shit go read a fucking report on how these organizations are formed, you ignorant cuckold
[17:31:04] <S3tanta> Baconaetor: so you're saying that it's not a prison because it's not a civilian prison?
[17:31:07] <S3tanta> you're an idiot

[18:21:13] <shelpe> i'm notorious
[18:21:14] <S3tanta> I haven't used heroin in almost a year
[18:21:21] <ganye> shelpe I also wasn't the one who banned you
[18:21:26] <Yuki> Everyone's addicted to heroin, they just don't know it yet.
[18:21:28] <shelpe> but
[18:21:30] <ganye> that was pleb
[18:21:31] <Sinc> if I had my druthers
[18:21:32] <shelpe> oh
[18:21:34] <Sinc> you'd still be banned, shelpe 
[18:21:35] <shelpe> that explains everything
[18:21:37] <ganye> lol
[18:21:41] <shelpe> it's easier to blame ganye 
[18:21:46] <S3tanta> in fact, I haven't used heroin in over a year
[18:21:50] <shelpe> thanks for being there for me ganye
[18:21:55] <Jaeger> Implying 
[18:21:55] <S3tanta> how can I be addicted if I haven't used it in over a year?
[18:21:56] <ganye> the only reason you were unbanned is because floby said to tbf
[18:22:05] <Jaeger> I totally believe you
[18:22:11] <Yuki> S3tanta: Because everyone's a heroin addict.
[18:22:13] <S3tanta> I totally don't care
[18:22:24] <ganye> S3tanta: why do you keep talking to the brick wall?
[18:22:34] <Jaeger> >I totally don't care

[18:23:59] <S3tanta> kek

[18:28:10] <Sinc> hah
[18:28:19] <S3tanta> and if they msg you asking to be unshuned before they've been shunned then they get shunned
[18:28:38] <Yuki> S3tanta: Then they'd just ask again.
[18:28:50] <S3tanta> not if there's a 1 week timeout
[18:29:13] <S3tanta> or if they get unshunned after a random time that increases every time they ask
[18:29:16] <ganye> wait how do I unshun someone?

[20:35:36] <sneak> fug da polis :DDDD
[20:49:51] *** Joins: Beef-Takeout (BeefEats@gen2-9B5FCC5F.lightspeed.hstntx.sbcglobal.net)
[20:58:52] <Jamie> uhh i basically just hacked the DAC and POS at Uni
[20:58:53] <Jamie> fuck
[20:58:54] <Jamie> (?)
[20:59:03] <Jamie> disappointing
[20:59:22] <shelpe> one time i found a public ip for an on campus printer and i printed a sexy lady
[20:59:28] <shelpe> this was freshman year
[20:59:32] <Jamie> hahah
[20:59:36] <Jamie> nice
[20:59:37] <Jamie> basically
[20:59:38] <Jamie> uh
[20:59:56] <Jamie> all that the freaking swipe cards do is contain the student number + an issue number
[21:00:01] <Jamie> both are printed on the front of the card
[21:00:14] <Jamie> and the student number commonly used when submitting coursework and viewing class lists
[21:00:14] <Jamie> ????
[21:00:14] <ganye> "hacked"
[21:00:23] <Jamie> ganye: by definition, sure
[21:00:36] <Jamie> how has nobody in the infosec department picked up on this and made them change it??
[21:00:41] <ganye> you figured out how to read a bar code/mag strip
[21:00:45] <ganye> "infosec department"
[21:00:51] <ganye> > made "them" change it
[21:00:52] <ganye> lmao
[21:01:02] <Yuki> PEPE IS DEAD
[21:01:02] <Jamie> it's a simple freaking fix
[21:01:08] <ganye> simple != cheap
[21:01:16] <Jamie> in this case it should be
[21:01:18] <ganye> and I'm sure you know all about how simple it would be
[21:01:28] <Jamie> you literally just raplce the issue number with a totally random number, i've seen how the card system works
[21:01:46] <ganye> for every single student?
[21:01:55] <Jamie> roll it out gradually
[21:02:01] <Jamie> say a student number is 100123456, an issue number is 12345601 for the 1st card
[21:02:18] <ganye> yes, this is where the "cheap" part ends
[21:02:19] <Jamie> the database stores both full values, so there's a link there
[21:02:27] <ganye> it's cheaper to leave it
[21:02:31] <ganye> why should they change it?
[21:02:34] <Jamie> and have everyone's money stolen
[21:02:38] <Yuki> Jamie: What is someone going to do? Steal your card number?
[21:02:44] <Jamie> because there are virtual wallets tied to it
[21:02:45] <ganye> clearly that hasn't happened
[21:02:47] <Jamie> people have £100s in there
[21:02:48] <Yuki> Take a few lunches?
[21:03:05] <Yuki> lmao
[21:03:09] <ganye> clearly no one is abusing this so they have zero incentive to change it
[21:03:10] <Yuki> Disgusting.
[21:03:12] <Jamie> how about go to the shop and buy a freaking iPad or something
[21:03:12] <ganye> changing it costs money
[21:03:20] <ganye> ok go do that
[21:03:23] <Jamie> as in the shop on campus
[21:03:29] <Jamie> one of my friends has £300 credit on it 
[21:03:31] <Jamie> i could, easily
[21:03:31] <Yuki> Jamie: They probably check your ID.
[21:03:37] <ganye> ok cool
[21:03:38] <Jamie> it /is/ your ID
[21:03:38] <ganye> then go do it
[21:03:40] <ganye> and leave us alone
[21:03:42] <Jamie> no, i'm not a douche
[21:03:48] <ganye> okay then stfu
[21:03:55] <Jamie> how could the vendor be so retarded in the first place though, wtf
[21:03:57] <Yuki> Yeah but they probably check a real ID.
[21:04:05] <Jamie> nah, student card is enough
[21:04:09] <Yuki> That or your picture pops up.
[21:04:11] <ganye> because people don't assume that someone is going to forge it
[21:04:26] <Jamie> then they assume stupidly
[21:04:29] <Yuki> That or you'd have to make a pretty convincing fake ID to get away with it.
[21:04:32] <ganye> > stupidly
[21:04:37] <ganye> it's ignorant, but it's not stu[id
[21:04:41] <ganye> s/[/p/
[21:04:42] <gtrackerbot5> ganye meant to say: it's ignorant, but it's not stupid
[21:04:47] <Yuki> Jamie: It's worked for them so far.
[21:04:51] <ganye> ^
[21:04:54] <Yuki> I fail to see how it's stupid in that context.
[21:05:06] <Yuki> Lazy maybe.
[21:05:11] <ganye> Yuki: Jamie just feels the need to prove she knows better
[21:05:22] <Jamie> how about you leave a house key under the mat?
[21:05:30] <Jamie> sure, it works so far, but in the future....???
[21:05:31] <ganye> ... yeah, people do that
[21:05:36] <ganye> what's your point?
[21:05:48] <Jamie> you could go into someone's room and steal their drugs!
[21:05:50] <ganye> those people aren't operating with a security mindset
[21:05:52] <Yuki> Jamie: How much do you think it would cost them to roll out an entirely new card system on campus?
[21:05:54] <ganye> that's ignorance, not stupidity
[21:06:00] <Jamie> Yuki: its compatible with the same system
[21:06:11] <Yuki> Probably more than a £300 refund to someone who had their card number stolen.
[21:06:13] <Jamie> all they do is change the format of the issue numbers and stop printing it on the front in barcode form
[21:06:49] <Yuki> Which requires them to redesign the card, reissue the card, *potentially reveal that the old card has a flaw*
[21:07:07] <Yuki> Have new software written for the issue number to be generated.
[21:07:18] <Yuki> And even then some dumbass with a credit card swiper can still steal your issue number.
[21:07:35] <Jamie> true
[21:07:39] <Jamie> but still
[21:07:46] <Jamie> i sharpied out the issue number
[21:07:46] <Jamie> :^)
[21:09:03] <ganye> you could try bitching to someone who actually matters about it
[21:09:22] <ganye> instead of just going > lol they're so stupid!
[21:09:25] <S3tanta> what are we bitching about?
[21:09:31] <shelpe> lol they're so stupid jamie!
[21:09:33] <S3tanta> oh, door cards?
[21:09:39] <S3tanta> let me tell you something about doorcards
[21:09:43] <Yuki> Be sure to tell them specifically that you "hacked the DAC and POS" 
[21:10:20] <S3tanta> hotels don't give a fuck about doorcards, you can walk right into the basement (first door beside the reception) in the radison hotel and print yourself a doorcard for any door in the radison hotel near dublin airport
[21:10:23] <floby> anyone here got gta on xbone
[21:10:41] <Yuki> Juries love it when you say that.
[21:10:47] <S3tanta> they don't give a fuck who goes into the basement, they'll only ask who you are if you go near the conference rooms since there's important men wearing suits
[21:11:41] <Yuki> S3tanta: You can make an arduino hack the doors of most hotel rooms.
[21:11:55] <S3tanta> cool, I'm gonna try that next time I'm in a hotel
[21:12:03] <S3tanta> only on my own door of course
[21:12:16] <Yuki> But it's still better than the old days when a room had the same key for literally every guest.
[21:12:25] <S3tanta> kek
[21:13:32] <Yuki> >mfw it's extremely illegal to even own a lockpick set without doing paperwork
[21:13:47] <ganye> wot
[21:13:56] <Yuki> It is in Colorado at least.
[21:14:00] <S3tanta> that's fucked
[21:14:09] <ganye> no it's not
[21:14:23] <Yuki> They'll assume you intended to do crimes with it.
[21:14:25] <S3tanta> you're only saying that because you like telling me I'm wrong
[21:14:30] <ganye> if you have them on you and they can prove intent they can charge you with burglary
[21:14:31] <ganye> but that's it
[21:14:48] <ganye> basically just don't be black
[21:14:55] <S3tanta> that goes for most laws
[21:14:59] <Yuki> Or under 30
[21:15:02] <Yuki> Or male
[21:15:35] <S3tanta> or poor
[21:15:42] <Yuki> Nah if they catch you with a lockpick set here and you didn't file to own one it's considered proof of intent.
[21:16:17] <ganye> CO law doesn't mention anything about having to file anything
[21:17:15] <sneak> kek Yuki 
[21:17:22] <Yuki> Huh maybe it's alright. I don't know where I saw that.
[21:18:32] <Yuki> >Sears sells lockpick sets
[21:18:33] <Yuki> y
[21:21:34] <sneak> y not
[21:21:41] <sneak> they're a tool
[21:24:30] <floby> .tell Arcaire lets play wow
[21:24:31] <Yuki> You're a tool.
[21:24:31] <gtrackerbot5> floby: I'll pass that on when Arcaire is around.
[21:24:57] <Sinc> Yuki you're a tool too
[21:25:06] <Sinc> >be ganye
[21:25:10] <Sinc> >know criminal law perfectly
[21:25:13] <Sinc> I knew you were a crim
[21:25:17] <ganye> lol
[21:25:56] <ganye> > be Uber
[21:26:02] <ganye> > explicitly state you price based on demand
[21:26:08] <ganye> > raise prices on New Year's Eve
[21:26:15] <ganye> > make the news for raising prices
[21:26:21] <Sinc> rip uber
[21:26:23] <Sinc> media is out for blood
[21:26:27] <ganye> j o u r n a l i s m   i s   d e a d
[21:26:47] <ganye> it's actually amazing how often "Uber raises prices for X" makes the news
[21:26:51] <floby> reddit killed journalism
[21:26:57] <Sinc> reddit IS journalism
[21:26:58] <Turbo> g  a  n  y  e     i  s     d  e  a  d
[21:27:01] <ganye> reddit + twitter tbh
[21:27:05] <S3tanta> clickbait in general killed journalism
[21:27:13] <ganye> clickbait is nothing new, stfu
[21:27:14] <S3tanta> some good journalism still exists
[21:27:19] <S3tanta> there's always the intercept
[21:27:21] <S3tanta> ganye pls
[21:27:23] <Yuki> News doesn't matter anymore.
[21:27:30] <Yuki> It doesn't matter what's going on in the world.
[21:27:31] <ganye> reddit + twitter just create a feedback loop of bullshit "reporting"
[21:27:58] <ganye> twitter "reports" something -> reddit reports it -> twitter reports the reddit report -> journalists pick up the twitter report
[21:28:02] <S3tanta> that's true, but the problem isn't that journalists said "let's be lazy", the problem is that journalists need to eat
[21:28:11] <S3tanta> so they do what people demand
[21:28:14] <ganye> yea I don't really blame them
[21:28:24] <S3tanta> which is low grade shit that idiots don't have to think about to understand
[21:28:24] <Sinc> I demand journalists give me blowjobs
[21:28:27] <ganye> they have to pick up on every single thread that comes up in order to be the first and get views
[21:28:28] <Sinc> DO WHAT I DEMAND
[21:28:36] <ganye> tbh machine learning is the future of journalism
[21:28:42] <S3tanta> I hope not
[21:28:46] <ganye> at least a computer has the speed to sift out what's legitimate and not
[21:28:50] <ganye> > future
[21:28:53] <ganye> lol jk it's already happening
[21:28:57] <S3tanta> :(
[21:29:03] <Sinc> S3tanta is the future of shitposting
[21:29:08] <Sinc> jk it's already happening
[21:29:14] <S3tanta> dank
[21:29:15] <Yuki> >Journalists no longer pursue leads in the real world
[21:29:17] <Yuki> lmao
[21:29:18] <ganye> a lot of news sites include tl;drs at the top of the article that are generated by AI
[21:29:33] <ganye> there's even a reddit bot that does it
[21:29:45] <Yuki> What
[21:30:00] <ganye> https://www.reddit.com/user/autotldr
[21:30:13] <Sinc> more like /user/karmanaut
[21:30:29] <ganye> lol
[21:30:34] <ganye> karmanaut's a meme now
[21:30:34] <ganye> pls
[21:31:30] <Yuki> This is disgusting.
[21:31:55] <Yuki> Oh I see.
[21:32:02] <Yuki> It's cherrypicking lines from the article.
[21:32:21] <ganye> yea, but the important part is how relevant the lines are
[21:32:26] <ganye> it's one thing to randomly pick a line
[21:32:32] <ganye> another to intelligently grab relevant lines
[21:32:47] <Yuki> But I can see how that would be trainable.
[21:33:23] <ganye> yea, it's a supervised learning algorithm
[21:33:26] <ganye> (I assume)
[21:33:45] <Sinc> That bot is better at editing than Slashdot's Soulskill, at least
[21:33:48] <S3tanta> Yeah but what about news that isn't availiable online because of censorship and it just not being known?
[21:33:50] <ganye> lol
[21:33:51] <S3tanta> ie: real news
[21:34:04] <ganye> S3tanta: it picks it up from real-time "news" sources
[21:34:07] <S3tanta> but
[21:34:10] <ganye> aka twitter, reddit, social media
[21:34:17] <S3tanta> that's not real news :(
[21:34:20] <Sinc> srsly tho
[21:34:25] <ganye> how so?
[21:34:28] <Sinc> I think it''s "worship Dice o' clock"
[21:34:39] <ganye> how is someone going "my village is being attacked by ISIS!" not real news?
[21:34:46] <S3tanta> oh, that is real news
[21:34:56] <S3tanta> but usually people being attacked by ISIS aren't on twitter
[21:35:02] <ganye> lmao
[21:35:06] <ganye> yea, they are
[21:35:08] <Sinc> The Internet Society of Intolerant Scum
[21:35:10] <ganye> depending on how close the attack is
[21:35:12] <S3tanta> I know, in some cases they are
[21:35:12] <Sinc> ISIS is literally cis scum
[21:35:28] <ganye> there's plenty of feeds you can track that show real-time militant attacks
[21:35:47] <ganye> like I said, it's just a matter of filtering out what's actual news and what's just a dank meme
[21:36:01] <S3tanta> I can't see that being easy
[21:36:04] <Sinc> Sometimes it's both
[21:36:10] <sneak> what is karmanaut
[21:36:12] <ganye> because it's not
[21:36:14] <S3tanta> you know some trading algorithms do that already
[21:36:25] <ganye> that's why it's not very prevalent atm
[21:36:34] <ganye> the algorithm would have to be pretty fucking smart
[21:36:44] <Yuki> ganye: I mean the closer it is to being a good TL;DR the more upvotes it will get for that comment.
[21:36:47] <shelpe> im smart
[21:36:54] <S3tanta> I'll look for a link or full story, but apperantly some company lost a shit ton of money when the PR twitter account of some company got hacked
[21:36:55] <Sinc> shelpe, sure you are dear
[21:36:56] <ganye> I'm sure DARPA/NSA/TLA is working on something like that
[21:36:57] <sneak> ganye pls algorithms are not misunderstood genius
[21:36:57] <Yuki> So it has a feedback loop.
[21:37:07] <ganye> Yuki: yea, that's what supervised learning is
[21:37:38] <sneak> what if auto tldr bot is not actually a bot
[21:37:39] <ganye> the AI takes in feedback about how "good" its prediction was and uses that for future assessment
[21:38:01] <sneak> is ganye an AI
[21:38:02] <Sinc> Yuki, not necessarily, it will also get lots of upvotes for meming
[21:38:06] <sneak> created by floby
[21:38:08] <Sinc> This is reddit, after all
[21:38:28] <Sinc> sneak, "Ganye" is the codeword for the current dev release of timhortons
[21:38:29] <Sinc> at all times
[21:38:33] <sneak> not good memes like the ones i harvest fresh from 4chon
[21:38:34] <Sinc> It's like sid, but for AI
[21:38:38] <shelpe> ganye is literally boy wonder, sneak 
[21:38:39] <shelpe> he's a bot
[21:38:39] <ganye> lol
[21:38:49] <ganye> > they didn't know I'm a bot
[21:38:49] <ganye> jfc
[21:39:01] <sneak> sid = unstable
[21:39:04] <sneak> ganye = sid
[21:39:07] <Sinc> good job, sneak
[21:39:08] <sneak> ganye = unstable
[21:39:13] <Sinc> you sure are fast on the uptake
[21:39:19] <sneak> ganye + sid
[21:39:20] <Yuki> Sinc: Yeah but that's also a good thing.
[21:39:22] <sneak> = stable
[21:39:28] <Sinc> ganye lol'd at that joke like a minute before you even started
[21:39:48] <sneak> if ganye is unstable

[23:27:06] <Salty> I called it toggaf :^)
[23:37:36] *** Joins: Baconaetor (Baconaetor@gen2-9575B0E9.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)
[23:38:20] <Baconaetor> alright guys, set me straight, su or sudo?
[23:38:28] <Baconaetor> I've heard both ways
[23:38:36] <shelpe> sudo
[23:38:38] <shelpe> i used to think su
[23:38:47] <Baconaetor> why is that?
[23:38:54] <Baconaetor> what's the rationale?
[23:38:56] <shelpe> but sudo is great because you can log every sudo command ever executed
[23:39:06] <Baconaetor> hmmm, that's good
[23:39:24] <shelpe> in addition you can make it so users can only execute certain binaries when using sudo
[23:39:27] <shelpe> or exclude binaries
[23:39:31] <Baconaetor> but I heard with sudo sometimes it hangs open, whereas with su you open and close the session
[23:39:39] <shelpe> oh i know nothing about that
[23:39:51] <shelpe> but security wise, if you tune your sudoers file corretly, it is superior
[23:40:13] <Baconaetor> hmm, ok, I'll have to take a look
[23:40:24] <Baconaetor> so how do I set the sudo password then?
[23:41:09] <shelpe> you mean
[23:41:12] <shelpe> the password for
[23:41:12] <shelpe> wat
[23:41:15] <shelpe> root password?
[23:41:18] <shelpe> what are you asking
[23:41:21] <Baconaetor> yes
[23:41:33] <shelpe> you mean you didn't set up root password when you installed your os?
[23:41:40] <Baconaetor> like the root password, how do I have a root password without a root account
[23:41:40] <shelpe> what ??? what did you install???
[23:42:03] <Baconaetor> the sudo/root password is just the password for the account I created
[23:42:14] <Baconaetor> but I want something seperate that will be a little more secure
[23:42:17] <shelpe> you want users to have to enter the root password when using sudo, right?
[23:42:33] <shelpe> oh ok
[23:42:42] <shelpe> so you have a specific account, that ONE ACCOUNT that has sudo access and nothing else
[23:42:52] <shelpe> you'll have to edit the sudoers file
[23:42:54] <shelpe> use visudo
[23:42:58] <shelpe> $ visudo
[23:44:03] <Baconaetor> so I create an account, that's sole purpose is to have sudo access?
[23:44:33] <Baconaetor> then when I'm logged into another account and type "sudo" I use that password?
[23:44:43] <shelpe> oh
[23:44:44] <shelpe> hmm
[23:44:47] <shelpe> i've never done that
[23:44:50] <shelpe> i'm not sure how to answer that
[23:45:02] <shelpe> really though, there's a lot of documentation on the sudoers file out there
[23:45:07] <shelpe> i suggest you take a look
[23:45:11] <shelpe> it's pretty powerful
[23:45:17] <Baconaetor> yeah I'm currently reading a few pages
[23:45:26] <Baconaetor> just wasn't sure if there was an easy solution
[23:45:31] <Baconaetor> I'm used to just using su
[23:45:42] <shelpe> the sudoers file is notoriously stupid to edit
[23:45:50] <shelpe> but sudo allows you to manage executed commands
[23:46:02] <shelpe> it's organized
[23:48:29] <Baconaetor> yeah, by default sudo stores your password for 15 minutes
[23:48:36] <Baconaetor> so it's open for that time frame
[23:48:41] <Baconaetor> I need to fix that
[23:48:49] <shelpe> ye you can change that
[23:48:55] <shelpe> you can make it ask every time if you want to
[23:48:57] <shelpe> or not ask at all
[23:52:39] <toggaf> TP: no clue, but i don't think it should
[23:55:32] <TP> maybe it's the cisco router they gave me
[23:56:27] <TP> but no matter what i do, the router blocks every protocol other than openvpn
[23:58:39] <ganye> [20:44:57]  <Baconaetor>	like the root password, how do I have a root password without a root account
[23:58:42] <ganye> jesus christ
[23:58:52] <sneak> wut
[23:59:00] <sneak> ban the redditor
[23:59:02] <toggaf> >root password without a root account
[23:59:04] <toggaf> ?????
[23:59:10] <sneak> oh wait that would be hypocritical of you, ganye
[23:59:23] <ganye> sure sweetie
[23:59:45] <sneak> Baconaetor, kill yourself reddit memer
[23:59:49] <sneak> bacon is shit
